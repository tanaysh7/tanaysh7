### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist/ ML Engineer holding a Master's degree in Data Science from University of Southern California, Los Angeles.  
I love building smart data-driven systems, with my skills in Software Development, Big Data and Machine Learning. I have a knack for problem solving and enjoy coding to realize my ideas. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking out for Full-time roles in Machine Learning/ Data science/ Data Engineering.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Open source projects, some of my ideas are listed [here](https://github.com/tanaysh7?tab=projects).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact details can be found [here](https://tanay.page.link/me).
