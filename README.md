### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a ML Engineer holding a Master's degree in Data Science from University of Southern California, Los Angeles.  
I love building smart data-driven systems, with my skills in Machine Learning, Software Development and Big Data. I have a knack for problem solving and enjoy coding to realize my ideas. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Engineer at [Cognistx](https://www.cognistx.com/), an applied AI company.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Open source projects, some of my ideas are listed [here](https://github.com/tanaysh7?tab=projects).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact details can be found [here](https://tanay.page.link/me).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube thrice in a single breath. PS. I think I'm still slow at solving it, but I'm a swimmer. :man_shrugging:
