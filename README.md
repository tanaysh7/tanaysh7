### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software/Data Engineer holding a Master's degree in Data Science from University of Southern California, Los Angeles.  
I love building smart data-driven distributed systems, with my skills in Machine Learning, Software Development and Big Data. I have a knack for problem solving and enjoy coding to realize my ideas. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com/).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Open source projects, some of my ideas are listed [here](https://github.com/tanaysh7?tab=projects).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to play Guitar and make music using FL studio.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact details can be found [here](https://tanay.page.link/me).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube twice in a single breath. PS. I think I'm still pretty slow at solving it, but I'm a swimmer. :man_shrugging:
